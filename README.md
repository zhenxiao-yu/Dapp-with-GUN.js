# Dapp-with-GUN.js

### Decentralized Databases with GUN.js
GUN.js is a real-time, decentralized, offline first, graph database. GUN allows for data synchronization to happen seamlessly between all connected nodes by default. Itâ€™s offline first capabilities mean that if connectivity is lost to other nodes due to a network error or no availability, the application will store all changes locally and automatically synchronize as soon there is a connection. The flexible data storage model allows for tables with relations (MSSQL or MySQL), as well as tree-structured document orientation (MongoDB).

### First Dapp

My first DApp is simply a note taking application in React using GUN. The application will support communication between two diffrent clients, when one client enters some text in the input area,GUN should update the input area in real between two diffrent clients.
